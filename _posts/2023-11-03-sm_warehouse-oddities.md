Continuing on with interesting things in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines:

During the quest Explosive Beginning, you visit a warehouse you need to blow up. You start at a train station, and have to make your way across the tracks to your destination. You quickly run into this otherwise unremarkable door, which the developers considered goofy for some reason:

Once you break into the central office to plant explosives, you find these large windows. The partialy transparency seems to break for unknown reasons sometimes. Either feeding on an enemy or reloading the game seems to cause it.

Screenshots are taken with the Unofficial Patch 9.6 Basic version.

The next installment will probably feature an interesting bug/property of the picker tool, and an implementation detail that it allows you to deduce together with noclip. Stay tuned.
