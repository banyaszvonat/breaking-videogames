This is a post to call attention to a couple other Spyro reverse engineering projects.

I was really happy about having been potentially the first to discover the level warp cheat, but it turns out I was beaten to it by at least 9 months by a more serious decompilation effort:
[https://github.com/TheMobyCollective/spyro-1/blame/main/src/cheats.c#L161](https://github.com/TheMobyCollective/spyro-1/blame/main/src/cheats.c#L161)

On the other hand, maybe it will turn out there's a secret level-specific activation method for it that neither of us know yet.

It's far from the only Spyro RE project:
[https://github.com/C0mposer/spyro1-reverse-engineering/](https://github.com/C0mposer/spyro1-reverse-engineering/)

Feels like suddenly (in the past 1-3 years) everyone had the same idea. Which is great, because a full decompilation would open up things like native ports, too. My own effort has been more about satisfying my own curiosity: finding out the secrets of one of the first 3D games I played. According to the git repo for the old r2 project file, I started poking it all the way back in 2021 for the first time, but set it aside after identifying the main game states. This was never intended to be a full decompile, but now I'm considering maybe contributing to that one.

However. I guess I have a writeup about Disgaea to finish too...
