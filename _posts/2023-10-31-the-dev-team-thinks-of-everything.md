Didn't take long to find more interesting material. Immediately after the last post, I was jumping around in the room, as one does. I discovered that Troika specifically anticipated players trying to jump on NPCs' heads, because there are AI states for handling this:

![Forward dive](/breaking-videogames/assets/dive_forward.png)
![Run back](/breaking-videogames/assets/run.png)

Therese rolls or dives forward, then runs back to one of a couple of preset points in the room. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a way to visualize this, as the command

> ai_show_hints

immediately crashes the game.
