Small easter egg I noticed when playing the Downtown hub area. In the beginning, there are NPCs belonging to two gangs, who will eventually start fighting each other, likely wiping out one side. Internally, the tank top guys are referred to as "jet":

And the tracksuit guys as "shark":

This seems to be a reference to the musical West Side Story.

An aside: this gang fight seems to be set up as a one-off event. The NPCs don't seem to respawn in general, although I spotted an `npc_maker` entity related to pedestrians that might be worth looking into later.
